Machine Learning AI. 

Planned Release 1:
AI will learn to differentiate objects placed in its "MAP" as good or bad as they are related to completing the task of finding "FOOD" (the exit condition). Simulation will be seeded by running 1 million times so that the AI can learn its environment before being observed.
